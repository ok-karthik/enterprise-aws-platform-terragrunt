A production-grade, multi-environment AWS platform architecture designed for scalability, security governance, and FinOps efficiency. This project demonstrates **Staff Engineer level patterns** in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) management, focusing on modularity, policy-driven security, and automated delivery.

## 🏛️ Project Architecture

This platform follows a **Hierarchical Blueprint Pattern** using Terragrunt. It separates the "Generic Blueprint Library" from the "Live Environment Implementation," ensuring 100% DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

## 🚀 The Automated Platform (CI/CD)

The core of this platform is a sophisticated **5-Stage Pipeline** that transitions infrastructure from code to production with multiple security and cost gates.

### Pipeline Workflow
1.  **🔍 Code Quality**: Recursive `TFLint` validation against AWS best practices.
2.  **🛡️ Security Gate**: Dual-engine scanning using `Checkov` (IaC compliance) and `Trivy` (vulnerability detection).
3.  **💰 Cost Visibility**: Real-time cost estimation per PR using `Infracost`, allowing for FinOps-driven engineering decisions.
4.  **🚀 Parallel Planning**: Simultaneous planning across all environment modules for rapid engineering feedback.
5.  **🚦 Manual Approval Gates**: Environment-protected deployment using GitHub Environments. No code reaches `Dev` or `Prod` without explicit manual review in the Actions UI.

## 🔐 Security & Governance

- **OIDC Authentication**: Zero long-lived AWS keys. All deployments use short-lived, trust-based OIDC tokens (OpenID Connect).
- **Least Privilege**: The CI/CD role is strictly scoped to specific IAM actions and repository branches.
- **Hierarchical Governance**: Global policies are enforced at the `root.hcl` and `_envcommon` layers, ensuring that every subsystem inherits standard tagging and security settings.

---

## 💰 FinOps & Efficiency

- **Spot Instances**: In the `dev` environment, EKS managed node groups are configured for Spot capacity to reduce costs by ~70-90%.
- **Lifecycle Management**: A dedicated **Manual Teardown Workflow** allows for surgical removal of resources in non-production environments to avoid "hidden" costs when stacks are not in use.
- **Tagging Policy**: Standardized tagging (`Project`, `Environment`, `Service`) is enforced at the module wrapper level to ensure 100% visibility in AWS Cost Explorer.

## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

1.  **Bootstrap**: See [infrastructure-bootstrap/README.md](infrastructure-bootstrap/README.md) for initial Day-0 setup.
2.  **Development**: Merge your infrastructure changes to a feature branch. Review the `Consolidated Report` in the PR.
3.  **Production**: Merge to `main`. The pipeline will pause for your manual approval before applying changes to the `prod` environment.
